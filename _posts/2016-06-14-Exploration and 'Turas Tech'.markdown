A resilient paradox that we all run into in life is that of position and experience. It is commonly encountered as recent graduates, like myself, seek employment, and it goes something like this:

*Proud graduate seeking employment peruses employment ad.*
<i> 

Requirements: Advanced aeronautical dynamics training, 3+ years constructing 	rocket engines (ideally with tools in your basement), experience working on ground-breaking research with international teams, etc., etc. 

Additional skills: Ancient Mandarin manuscripts, thermodynamic acceleration principles, hardware dialect manipulation, etc., etc.
</i>

*Once proud graduate commences wallowing in self-pity.*

I suppose the requirements are the bare necessities, from the root term 'require'. Beyond those is the fun, “additional skills” section, which aren't 'required', but just good talents (read: super-powers) to have; you know, like icing on the cake.

Hyperbole aside, it seems the attainment of position assumes raw field experience, which in turn assumes some kind of position by which to gain said experience. Of course there are loopholes for this paradox, like internships, and job acquisition through networking. But for a young, self-taught programmer like myself, those are hard to come by. Along with the temporary discouragement that can come with this unfortunate paradox, there is another, more insidious, side-effect. One can be led to feel as though learning is something best left for the unemployed, or the past. Such an employment advertisement seems to taunt: “Hopefully you've learned everything you need for this job by now, and if you haven't, don't bother applying.” That's a hard message to swallow when you feel like all you're doing is learning.

Though I'm no expert, I'm fairly certain employment ads are meant to be exaggerative to weed out the clearly unqualified, and I think interacting with a human being concerning employment would be much more conversational than reading a list of hard application pre-requisites. But when the only interaction you've had with programming applications is these ads, the cold, hard list of qualifications is all you really know. And that message sounds loud and clear after you've seen it on a dozen employment ads.

(I'd like to note here: I have nothing against the formal job world with its employment ads, and the deadlines and demands of a serious job. They're necessary for an order of their own, and I respect that. I'm just using that structure as a metaphor.)

<em> ******************** </em>

Over the past 16 months or so, I've spent the better part of my work hours purely learning. I've discovered a helpful, seemingly obvious axiom (as many are). Learning precedes comprehension. When first introduced to a topic, it's almost complete confusion. I don't know where I am. I don't know what I'm reading. Most of the significant words mean nothing to me, because they depend on other significant words for their meaning. When I'm trying learn, my browser bar always looks like this:


That's 27 tabs by my count. And I sometimes have more than one browser session open. Notice how many google tabs there are – 12. I google hundreds of times a day when I learn. The other 15 web sites – programming documentation, online portals, blog tutorials, local servers, and stack overflow (hallelujah). I'll also have numerous other programs open. Postman for HTTP requests. Xcode for iOS development. Atom for text editing (usually multiple tabs of source code). Source tree for version control. Evernote for notes and outlines I've created. Maybe a database visualization tool.

In all this, there's a fairly systematic approach. I see it like diving into the ocean – you can't get familiar with it until you explore. You probably won't understand most of what you see, or even know how to interpret it. But even though there isn't comprehension yet, there is learning. Once you see the same trends appear again and again over time, they get shaped in your mind. You learn what's common, and what's not. What's out there and what's not. What's impressive and what's not. What's rare. What's valuable. Important. Despised. Insignificant. Wonderful. This is paramount for comprehension. It's the time during which a grid is created in your mind, into which you can store information. 

Information in a field largely makes sense in relation to other information in that field. I can only explain where my house is to you, if you have a familiarity with the grid that is my town. Of course I could give you specific directions, but then you're not learning, you're just following directions. You can arrive at my house without knowing how to navigate anywhere else. You would learn to navigate by spending time traversing the town, and creating, quite literally, a mental grid. This learning is natural, necessary, and can be a lot of fun. Eventually the things you see start to connect, meaning and order evolve from chaos, and comprehension is established.

How does this relate to employment ads? When you're facing a list of prerequisites for a job (particularly prerequisites you don't measure up to), it can seem like the time it takes to explore is a hindrance. There are deadlines to meet, people to see, places to go, and perhaps most pressing, bills to pay. I have those things too. I just find it unfortunate that exploration, learning, and curiosity are often left out of the equation because of the demands of life. Growing and learning is hard, and it takes discipline and time – more than I think I have on occasion. But there is so much to see. So many decisions to make. So many things to discover.

Turas Tech was actually a name a friend of mine suggested for my business. I don't think he expected me to go with it. 'Turas' means 'journey, expedition, pilgrimage' in Gaelic. Gaelic doesn't mean much to me – I have no Gaelic roots. I like that word though. It's how I want to approach the work I do. I want to have excellent comprehension, and I want to be able to meet the hardest of deadlines and understand the most verbose code. I'm not there yet. And I'm not afraid of that. There is a lot that I don't know yet, but I have confidence that my passion for learning will get me there. 

Turas Tech is my business. It's how I make a living. I have projects to get done, and bills to pay. And as I do those things, I use my business to sustain my exploration of the ocean around me. It's confusing and intimidating, and it can be draining too, but more often than not, it's fun and energizing. I'm unwilling to let the demands of life steal the joy of learning. I may take longer to finish a project, and I may not get there the quickest way or build the best solution. However, I will have explored many paths along the way, and be a better navigator because of it.
